title: Implicit Parameter-free Online Learning with Truncated Linear Models
abstract: Parameter-free algorithms are online learning algorithms that do not require
  setting learning rates. They achieve optimal regret with respect to the distance
  between the initial point and any competitor. Yet, parameter-free algorithms do
  not take into account the geometry of the losses. Recently, in the stochastic optimization
  literature, it has been proposed to instead use truncated linear lower bounds, which
  produce better performance by more closely modeling the losses. In particular, truncated
  linear models greatly reduce the problem of overshooting the minimum of the loss
  function. Unfortunately, truncated linear models cannot be used with parameter-free
  algorithms because the updates become very expensive to compute. In this paper,
  we propose new parameter-free algorithms that can take advantage of truncated linear
  models through a new update that has an “implicit” flavor. Based on a novel decomposition
  of the regret, the new update is efficient, requires only one gradient at each step,
  never overshoots the minimum of the truncated model, and retains the favorable parameter-free
  properties. We also conduct an empirical study demonstrating the practical utility
  of our algorithms.
