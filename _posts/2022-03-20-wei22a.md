title: A Model Selection Approach for Corruption Robust Reinforcement Learning
abstract: 'We develop a model selection approach to tackle reinforcement learning
  with adversarial corruption in both transition and reward. For finite-horizon tabular
  MDPs, without prior knowledge on the total amount of corruption, our algorithm achieves
  a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\min\{\frac{1}{\Delta}, \sqrt{T}\}+C)$ where $T$ is
  the number of episodes, $C$ is the total amount of corruption, and $\Delta$ is the
  reward gap between the best and the second-best policy. This is the first worst-case
  optimal bound achieved without knowledge of $C$, improving previous results of Lykouris
  et al. (2021), Chen et al. (2021), Wu et al. (2021). For finite-horizon linear MDPs,
  we develop a computationally efficient algorithm with a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{(1+C)T})$,
  and another computationally inefficient one with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}+C)$, improving
  the result of Lykouris et al. (2021) and answering an open question by Zhang et
  al. (2021). Finally, our model selection framework can be easily applied to other
  settings including linear bandits, linear contextual bandits, and MDPs with general
  function approximation, leading to several improved or new results. '
