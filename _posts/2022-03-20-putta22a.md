title: Scale-Free Adversarial Multi Armed Bandits
abstract: We consider the  Scale-Free Adversarial Multi Armed Bandits(MAB) problem.
  At the beginning of the game, the player only knows the number of arms $n$.  It
  does not know the scale and magnitude of the losses chosen by the adversary or the
  number of rounds $T$. In each round, it sees bandit feedback about the loss vectors
  $l_1,…, l_T \in \mathbb{R}^n$. The goal is to bound its regret as a function of
  $n$ and norms of $l_1,…, l_T$. We design a bandit Follow The Regularized Leader
  (FTRL) algorithm, that uses an adaptive learning rate and give two different regret
  bounds, based on the exploration parameter used. With non-adaptive exploration,
  our algorithm has a regret of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{nL_2} + L_\infty\sqrt{nT})$
  and with adaptive exploration, it has a regret of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{nL_2}
  + L_\infty\sqrt{nL_1})$. Here $L_\infty = \sup_t \| l_t\|_\infty$, $L_2 = \sum_{t=1}^T
  \|l_t\|_2^2$, $L_1 = \sum_{t=1}^T \|l_t\|_1$ and the $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}$ notation
  suppress logarithmic factors. These are the first MAB bounds that adapt to the $\|\cdot\|_2$,
  $\|\cdot\|_1$ norms of the losses. The second bound is the first data-dependent
  scale-free MAB bound as $T$ does not directly appear in the regret. We also develop
  a new technique for obtaining a rich class of local-norm lower-bounds for Bregman
  Divergences. This technique plays a crucial role in our analysis for controlling
  the regret when using importance weighted estimators of unbounded losses. This technique
  could be of independent interest.
