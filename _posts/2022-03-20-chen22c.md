title: Algorithms for learning a mixture of linear classifiers
abstract: " Linear classifiers are a basic model in supervised learning. We study
  the problem of learning a mixture of linear classifiers over Gaussian marginals.
  Despite significant interest in this problem, including in the context of neural
  networks, basic questions like efficient learnability and identifiability of the
  model remained open.  In this paper, we design algorithms for recovering the parameters
  of the mixture of $k$ linear classifiers. We obtain two algorithms which both have
  polynomial dependence on the ambient dimension $n$, and incur an exponential dependence
  either on the number of the components $k$ or a natural separation parameter $\\Delta>0$.
  These algorithmic results in particular settle the identifiability question under
  provably minimal assumptions."
