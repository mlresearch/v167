title: Limiting Behaviors of Nonconvex-Nonconcave Minimax Optimization via Continuous-Time
  Systems
abstract: 'Unlike nonconvex optimization, where gradient descent is guaranteed to
  converge to a local optimizer, algorithms for nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization
  can have topologically different solution paths: sometimes converging to a solution,
  sometimes never converging and instead following a limit cycle, and sometimes diverging.
  In this paper, we study the limiting behaviors of three classic minimax algorithms:
  gradient descent ascent (GDA), alternating gradient descent ascent (AGDA), and the
  extragradient method (EGM). Numerically, we observe that all of these limiting behaviors
  can arise in Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) training and are easily demonstrated
  even in simple GAN models. To explain these different behaviors, we study the high-order
  resolution continuous-time dynamics that correspond to each algorithm, which results
  in sufficient (and almost necessary) conditions for the local convergence by each
  method. Moreover, this ODE perspective allows us to characterize the phase transition
  between these potentially nonconvergent limiting behaviors caused by introducing
  regularization in the problem instance. '
