title: Distributed Online Learning for Joint Regret with Communication Constraints
abstract: We consider distributed online learning for joint regret with communication
  constraints. In this setting, there are multiple agents that are connected in a
  graph. Each round, an adversary first activates one of the agents to issue a prediction
  and provides a corresponding gradient, and then the agents are allowed to send a
  $b$-bit message to their neighbors in the graph. All agents cooperate to control
  the joint regret, which is the sum of the losses of the activated agents minus the
  losses evaluated at the best fixed common comparator parameters $u$. We observe
  that it is suboptimal for agents to wait for gradients that take too long to arrive.
  Instead, the graph should be partitioned into local clusters that communicate among
  themselves.  Our main result is a new method that can adapt to the optimal graph
  partition for the adversarial activations and gradients, where the graph partition
  is selected from a set of candidate partitions. A crucial building block along the
  way is a new algorithm for online convex optimization with delayed gradient information
  that is comparator-adaptive, meaning that its joint regret scales with the norm
  of the comparator $||u||$. We further provide near-optimal gradient compression
  schemes depending on the ratio of $b$ and the dimension times the diameter of the
  graph.
