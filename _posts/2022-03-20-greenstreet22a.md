title: Efficient and Optimal Fixed-Time Regret with Two Experts
abstract: Prediction with expert advice is a foundational problem in online learning.
  In instances with \(T\){rounds} and \(n\){experts}, the classical Multiplicative
  Weights Update method suffers at most \(\sqrt{(T/2)\ln n}\){regret} when \(T\){is}
  known beforehand. Moreover, this is asymptotically optimal when both \(T\){and}
  \(n\){grow} to infinity. However, when the number of experts \(n\){is} small/fixed,
  algorithms with better regret guarantees exist.  Cover showed in 1967 a dynamic
  programming algorithm for the two-experts problem restricted to \(\{0,1\}\){costs}
  that suffers at most \(\sqrt{T/2\pi} + O(1)\){regret} with \(O(T^2)\){pre}-processing
  time. In this work, we propose an optimal algorithm for prediction with two expertsâ€™
  advice that works even for costs in \([0,1]\){and} with \(O(1)\){processing} time
  per turn. Our algorithm builds up on recent work on the experts problem based on
  techniques and tools from stochastic calculus.
