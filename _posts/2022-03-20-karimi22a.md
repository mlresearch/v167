title: Minimization by Incremental Stochastic Surrogate Optimization for Large Scale
  Nonconvex Problems
abstract: Many constrained, nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems can be tackled
  using the majorization-minimization (MM) method which alternates between constructing
  a surrogate func- tion which upper bounds the objective function, and then minimizing
  this surrogate. For problems which minimize a finite sum of functions, a stochastic
  version of the MM method selects a batch of functions at random at each iteration
  and optimizes the accumulated surrogate. However, in many cases of interest such
  as variational inference for latent variable models, the surrogate functions are
  expressed as an expectation. In this contribution, we propose a doubly stochastic
  MM method based on Monte Carlo approximation of these stochastic surrogates. We
  establish asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence of our scheme in a constrained,
  nonconvex, nonsmooth optimization setting. We apply our new framework for inference
  of logistic regression model with missing data and for variational inference of
  Bayesian variants of LeNet-5 and Resnet-18 on benchmark datasets.
