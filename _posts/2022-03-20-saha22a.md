title: Efficient and Optimal Algorithms for Contextual Dueling Bandits under Realizability
abstract: We study the $K$-armed contextual dueling bandit problem, a sequential decision
  making setting in which the learner uses contextual information to make two decisions,
  but only observes \emph{preference-based feedback} suggesting that one decision
  was better than the other. We focus on the regret minimization problem under realizability,
  where the feedback is generated by a pairwise preference matrix that is well-specified
  by a given function class $\mathcal F$. We provide a new algorithm that achieves
  the optimal regret rate for a new notion of best response regret, which is a strictly
  stronger performance measure than those considered in prior works. The algorithm
  is also computationally efficient, running in polynomial time assuming access to
  an online oracle for square loss regression over $\mathcal F$. This resolves an
  open problem of Dudik et al. (2015) on oracle efficient, regret-optimal algorithms
  for contextual dueling bandits.
