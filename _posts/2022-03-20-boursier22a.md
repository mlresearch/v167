title: Social Learning in Non-Stationary Environments
abstract: 'Potential buyers of a product or service, before making their decisions,
  tend to read reviews written by previous consumers. We consider Bayesian consumers
  with heterogeneous preferences, who sequentially decide whether to buy an item of
  unknown quality, based on previous buyersâ€™ reviews. The quality is multi-dimensional
  and may occasionally vary over time; the reviews are also multi-dimensional. In
  the simple uni-dimensional and static setting, beliefs about the quality are known
  to converge to its true value. Our paper extends this result in several ways. First,
  a multi-dimensional quality is considered, second, rates of convergence are provided,
  third, a dynamical Markovian model with varying quality is studied. In this dynamical
  setting the cost of learning is shown to be small. '
