title: Polynomial-Time Sum-of-Squares Can Robustly Estimate Mean and Covariance of
  Gaussians Optimally
abstract: 'In this work, we revisit the problem of estimating the mean and covariance
  of an unknown $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution in the presence of an $\varepsilon$-fraction
  of adversarial outliers. The work of Diakonikolas et al. (2016) gave a polynomial
  time algorithm for this task with optimal $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon)$ error using $n
  = \textrm{poly}(d, 1/\varepsilon)$ samples.  On the other hand, Kothari and Steurer
  (2017) introduced a general framework for robust moment estimation via a canonical
  sum-of-squares relaxation that succeeds for the more general class of \emph{certifiably
  subgaussian} and \emph{certifiably hypercontractive}Â (Bakshi and Kothari, 2020)
  distributions. When specialized to Gaussians, this algorithm obtains the same $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon)$
  error guarantee as Diakonikolas et al. (2016) but incurs a super-polynomial sample
  complexity ($n = d^{O(\log 1/\varepsilon)}$) and running time ($n^{O(\log(1/\varepsilon))}$).
  This cost appears inherent to their analysis as it relies only on sum-of-squares
  certificates of upper bounds on directional moments while the analysis in Diakonikolas
  et al. (2016) relies on \emph{lower bounds} on directional moments inferred from
  algebraic relationships between moments of Gaussian distributions.  We give a new,
  simple analysis of the \emph{same} canonical sum-of-squares relaxation used in Kothari
  and Steurer (2017) and Bakshi and Kothari (2020) and show that for Gaussian distributions,
  their algorithm achieves the same error, sample complexity and running time guarantees
  as of the specialized algorithm in Diakonikolas et al. (2016). Our key innovation
  is a new argument that allows using moment lower bounds without having sum-of-squares
  certificates for them. We believe that our proof technique will likely be useful
  in designing new robust estimation algorithms. '
