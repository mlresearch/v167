title: 'Universal Online Learning with Unbounded Losses: Memory Is All You Need'
abstract: 'We resolve an open problem of Hanneke (2021) on the subject of universally
  consistent online learning with non-i.i.d. processes and unbounded losses. The notion
  of an optimistically universal learning rule was defined by Hanneke in an effort
  to study learning theory under minimal assumptions. A given learning rule is said
  to be optimistically universal if it achieves a low long-run average loss whenever
  the data generating process makes this goal achievable by some learning rule. Hanneke
  (2021) posed as an open problem whether, for every unbounded loss, the family of
  processes admitting universal learning are precisely those having a finite number
  of distinct values almost surely. In this paper, we completely resolve this problem,
  showing that this is indeed the case. As a consequence, this also offers a dramatically
  simpler formulation of an optimistically universal learning rule for any unbounded
  loss: namely, the simple memorization rule already suffices. Our proof relies on
  constructing random measurable partitions of the instance space. This technique
  may be of independent interest in providing useful arguments towards solving the
  remaining open question of optimistically universal online learning for bounded
  losses.'
