title: Universally Consistent Online Learning with Arbitrarily Dependent Responses
abstract: This work provides an online learning rule that is universally consistent
  under processes on (X,Y) pairs, under conditions only on the X process.  As a special
  case, the conditions admit all processes on (X,Y) such that the process on X is
  stationary.  This generalizes past results which required stationarity for the joint
  process on (X,Y), and additionally required this process to be ergodic.  In particular,
  this means that ergodicity is superfluous for the purpose of universally consistent
  online learning.
