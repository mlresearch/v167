title: Distinguishing Relational Pattern Languages With a Small Number of Short Strings
abstract: This paper studies the equivalence problem for relational pattern languages,
  where a relation imposes dependencies between the two strings with which two variables
  in a pattern can be replaced simultaneously. Our focus is on the question whether
  the non-equivalence of two relational patterns is witnessed by short strings, namely
  those generated by replacing variables in the patterns by strings of length bounded
  by some (small) number $z$.  After establishing a close connection between this
  problem and the study of the notions of \emph{teaching dimension}\/{and} \emph{no-clash
  teaching dimension}, we investigate specific classes of relational pattern languages.
  We show that the smallest number $z$ that serves as a bound for testing equivalence
  is $2$ when the relation between variable substitutions is that of equal string
  length, and the alphabet size it at least 3. This has interesting implications on
  the size and form of non-clashing teaching sets for the corresponding languages.
  By contrast, not even $z=3$ is sufficient when the constraints require two substituted
  strings to be the reversal of one another, for alphabets of size 2. We conclude
  with a negative result on erasing pattern languages.
