title: On the Last Iterate Convergence of Momentum Methods
abstract: SGD with Momentum (SGDM) is a widely used family of algorithms for large
  scale optimization of machine learning problems. Yet, when optimizing generic convex
  functions, no advantage is known for any SGDM algorithm over plain SGD. Moreover,
  even the most recent results require changes to the SGDM algorithms, like averaging
  of the iterates and a projection onto a bounded domain, which are rarely used in
  practice. In this paper, we focus on the convergence rate of the last iterate of
  SGDM. For the first time, we prove that for any constant momentum factor, there
  exists a Lipschitz and convex function for which the last iterate of SGDM suffers
  from a suboptimal convergence rate of $\Omega(\frac{\log T}{\sqrt{T}})$ after $T$
  iterations. Based on this fact, we study a class of (both adaptive and non-adaptive)
  Follow-The-Regularized-Leader-based SGDM algorithms with \emph{increasing momentum}
  and \emph{shrinking updates}. For these algorithms, we show that the last iterate
  has optimal convergence $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$ for unconstrained convex stochastic
  optimization problems without projections onto bounded domains nor knowledge of
  $T$. Further, we show a variety of results for FTRL-based SGDM when used with adaptive
  stepsizes. Empirical results are shown as well.
