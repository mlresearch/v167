title: Efficient local planning with linear function approximation
abstract: We study query and computationally efficient planning algorithms for discounted
  Markov decision processes (MDPs) with linear function approximation and a simulator.
  The agent is assumed to have local access to the simulator, meaning that the simulator
  can be queried only at states that have been encountered in previous steps. We propose
  two new algorithms for this setting, which we call confident Monte Carlo least-squares
  policy iteration (Confident MC-LSPI), and confident Monte Carlo Politex (Confident
  MC-Politex), respectively. The main novelty in our algorithms is that they gradually
  build a set of state-action pairs (“core set”) with which it can control the extrapolation
  errors. We show that our algorithms have polynomial query and computational cost
  in the dimension of the features, the effective planning horizon and the targeted
  sub-optimality, while the cost remains independent of the size of the state space.
  An interesting technical contribution of our work is the introduction of a novel
  proof technique that makes use of a virtual policy iteration algorithm. We use this
  method to leverage existing results on  approximate policy iteration with $\ell_\infty$-bounded
  error to show that our algorithm can learn the optimal policy for the given initial
  state even only with local access to the simulator. We believe that this technique
  can be extended to broader settings beyond this work.
