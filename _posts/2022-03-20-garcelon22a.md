title: Privacy Amplification via Shuffling for Linear Contextual Bandits
abstract: Contextual bandit algorithms are widely used in domains where it is desirable
  to provide a personalized service by leveraging contextual information, that may
  contain sensitive information that needs to be protected. Inspired by this scenario,
  we study the contextual linear bandit problem with differential privacy (DP) constraints.
  While the literature has focused on either centralized (joint DP) or local (local
  DP) privacy, we consider the shuffle model of privacy and we show that it is possible
  to achieve a privacy/utility trade-off between JDP and LDP. By leveraging shuffling
  from privacy and batching from bandits, we present an algorithm with regret bound
  $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3}/\varepsilon^{1/3})$, while guaranteeing both central
  (joint) and local privacy. Our result shows that it is possible to obtain a trade-off
  between JDP and LDP by leveraging the shuffle model while preserving local privacy.
