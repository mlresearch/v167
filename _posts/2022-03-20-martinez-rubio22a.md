title: Global Riemannian Acceleration in Hyperbolic and Spherical Spaces
abstract: " We further research on the accelerated optimization phenomenon on Riemannian
  manifolds by introducing accelerated global first-order methods for the optimization
  of $L$-smooth and geodesically convex (g-convex) or $\\mu$-strongly g-convex functions
  defined on the hyperbolic space or a subset of the sphere. For a manifold other
  than the Euclidean space, these are the first methods to \\emph{globally} achieve
  the same rates as accelerated gradient descent in the Euclidean space with respect
  to $L$ and $\\epsilon$ (and $\\mu$ if it applies), up to log factors. Previous results
  with these accelerated rates only worked, given strong g-convexity, in a small neighborhood
  (initial distance $R$ to a minimizer being $R = O((\\mu/L)^{3/4})$). Our rates have
  a polynomial factor on $1/\\cos(R)$ (spherical case) or $\\cosh(R)$ (hyperbolic
  case). Thus, we completely match the Euclidean case for a constant initial distance,
  and for larger $R$ we incur greater constants due to the geometry. As a proxy for
  our solution, we solve a constrained non-convex Euclidean problem, under a condition
  between convexity and \\textit{quasar-convexity}, of independent interest. Additionally,
  for any Riemannian manifold of bounded sectional curvature, we provide reductions
  from optimization methods for smooth and g-convex functions to methods for smooth
  and strongly g-convex functions and vice versa.  "
