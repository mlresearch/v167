title: Asymptotic Degradation of Linear Regression Estimates with Strategic Data Sources
abstract: We consider the problem of linear regression from strategic data sources
  with a public good component, i.e., when data is provided by strategic agents who
  seek to minimize an individual provision cost for increasing their data’s precision
  while benefiting from the model’s overall precision. In contrast to previous works,
  our model tackles the case where there is uncertainty on the attributes characterizing
  the agents’ data—a critical aspect of the problem when the number of agents is large.  We
  provide a characterization of the game’s equilibrium, which reveals an interesting
  connection with optimal design. Subsequently, we focus on the asymptotic behavior
  of the covariance of the linear regression parameters estimated via generalized
  least squares as the number of data sources becomes large. We provide upper and
  lower bounds for this covariance matrix and we show that, when the agents’ provision
  costs are superlinear, the model’s covariance converges to zero but at a slower
  rate relative to virtually all learning problems with exogenous data. On the other
  hand, if the agents’ provision costs are linear, this covariance fails to converge.
  This shows that even the basic property of consistency of generalized least squares
  estimators is compromised when the data sources are strategic.
