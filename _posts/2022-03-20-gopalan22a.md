title: Multicalibrated Partitions for Importance Weights
abstract: 'The ratio between the probability that two distributions assign to points
  in the domain are called importance weights or density ratios and they play a fundamental
  role in machine learning and information theory. However, there are strong lower
  bounds known for point-wise accurate estimation of density ratios, and most theoretical
  guarantees require strong assumptions about the distributions. We motivate the problem
  of seeking accuracy guarantees for the distribution of importance weights conditioned
  on sub-populations belonging to a family $\mathcal{C}$ of subsets of the domain. We formulate
  {\em sandwiching bounds} for sets: upper and lower bounds on the expected importance
  weight conditioned on a set; as a notion of set-wise accuracy for importance weights.
  We argue that they capture intuitive expectations about importance weights, and
  are not subject to the strong lower bounds for point-wise guarantees. We introduce
  the notion of multicalibrated partitions for a class $\mathcal{C}$, inspired by
  recent work on multi-calibration in supervised learning and show that the importance
  weights resulting from such partitions do satisfy sandwiching bounds. In contrast,
  we show that importance weights returned by popular algorithms in the literature
  may violate the  sandwiching bounds. We present an efficient algorithm for constructing
  multi-calibrated partitions, given a weak agnostic learner for the class $\mathcal{C}$.'
