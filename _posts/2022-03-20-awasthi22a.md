title: Understanding Simultaneous Train and Test Robustness
abstract: This work concerns the study of robust learning algorithms. In practical
  settings, it is desirable to achieve robustness to many different types of corruptions
  and shifts in the data distribution such as defending against adversarial examples,
  dealing with covariate shifts, and contamination of training data (data poisoning).
  While there has been extensive recent work on these topics, models and algorithms
  for these different notions of robustness have been largely developed in isolation.
  In this paper, we propose a natural notion of robustness that allows us to simultaneously
  reason about train-time and test-time corruptions, that can be measured using various
  distance metrics (e.g., total variation distance, Wasserstein distance). We study
  our proposed notion in three fundamental settings in supervised and unsupervised
  learning (of regression, classification and mean estimation). In each case we design
  sample and time-efficient learning algorithms with strong simultaneous train-and-test
  robustness guarantees.  In particular, our work shows that the two seemingly different
  notions of robustness at train-time and test-time are closely related, and this
  connection can be leveraged to develop algorithmic techniques that are applicable
  in both the settings.
