title: Learning with Distributional Inverters
abstract: We generalize the “indirect learning” technique of Furst et al. (1991) to
  reduce from learning a concept class over a samplable distribution $\mu$ to learning
  the same concept class over the uniform distribution. The reduction succeeds when
  the sampler for $\mu$ is both contained in the target concept class and efficiently
  invertible in the sense of Impagliazzo and Luby (1989). We give two applications.
  \begin{itemize} \item We show that $\mathsf{AC}^0[q]$ is learnable over any succinctly-described
  product distribution. $\mathsf{AC}^0[q]$ is the class of constant-depth Boolean
  circuits of polynomial size with AND, OR, NOT, and counting modulo $q$ gates of
  unbounded fanins. Our algorithm runs in randomized quasi-polynomial time and uses
  membership queries. \item If there is a strongly useful natural property in the
  sense of Razborov and Rudich (1997) — an efficient algorithm that can distinguish
  between random strings and strings of non-trivial circuit complexity — then general
  polynomial-sized Boolean circuits are learnable over any efficiently samplable distribution
  in randomized polynomial time, given membership queries to the target function.
  \end{itemize}
