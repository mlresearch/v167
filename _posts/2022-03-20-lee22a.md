title: Improved rates for prediction and identification of partially observed linear
  dynamical systems
abstract: 'Identification of a linear time-invariant dynamical system from partial
  observations is a fundamental problem in control theory. Particularly challenging
  are systems exhibiting long-term memory. A natural question is how learn such systems
  with non-asymptotic statistical rates depending on the inherent dimensionality (order)
  $d$ of the system, rather than on the possibly much larger memory length. We propose
  an algorithm that given a single trajectory of length $T$ with gaussian observation
  noise, learns the system with a near-optimal rate of $\widetilde O\left(\sqrt\frac{d}{T}\right)$
  in $\mathcal{H}_2$ error, with only logarithmic, rather than polynomial dependence
  on memory length. We also give bounds under process noise and improved bounds for
  learning a realization of the system. Our algorithm is based on multi-scale low-rank
  approximation: SVD applied to Hankel matrices of geometrically increasing sizes.
  Our analysis relies on careful application of concentration bounds on the Fourier
  domainâ€”we give sharper concentration bounds for sample covariance of correlated
  inputs and for $\mathcal H_\infty$ norm estimation, which may be of independent
  interest.'
