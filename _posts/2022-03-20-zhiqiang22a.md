title: Faster Noisy Power Method
abstract: Given the capability to handle diverse resource constraints, such as communication,
  memory, or privacy, the noisy power method, as a meta algorithm for computing the
  dominant eigenspace of a matrix, has found wide applications in data analysis and
  statistics (e.g., PCA). For an input data matrix, the performance of the algorithm,
  as with the noiseless case, is characterized by the spectral gap, which largely
  dictates the convergence rate and affects the noise tolerance level as well. A recent
  analysis improved the dependency over the consecutive spectral gap $(\lambda_{k}-\lambda_{k+1})$
  to the dependency over $(\lambda_{k}-\lambda_{q+1})$, where $q$ could be much greater
  than the target rank $k$ and thus result in better performance by a significantly
  larger gap. However, $(\lambda_{k}-\lambda_{q+1})$ could still be quite small and
  potentially limit the applicability. In this paper, we further improve the dependency
  of the convergence rate over $O(\lambda_{k}-\lambda_{q+1})$ to dependency over $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\lambda_{k}-\lambda_{q+1}})$
  in a certain regime of a new parameter, for a faster noise-tolerant algorithm. To
  achieve this goal, we propose faster noisy power method which introduces the momentum
  acceleration into the noisy power iteration, and present a novel analysis that differs
  from previous ones. We also extend our algorithm to the distributed PCA and memory-efficient
  streaming PCA and get improved results accordingly in terms of the gap dependence.
