title: Learning what to remember
abstract: We consider a lifelong learning scenario in which a learner faces a neverending
  and arbitrary stream of facts and has to decide which ones to retain in its limited
  memory. We introduce a mathematical model based on the online learning framework,
  in which the learner measures itself against a collection of experts that are also
  memory-constrained and that reflect different policies for what to remember. Interspersed
  with the stream of facts are occasional questions, and on each of these the learner
  incurs a loss if it has not remembered the corresponding fact. Its goal is to do
  almost as well as the best expert in hindsight, while using roughly the same amount
  of memory. We identify difficulties with using the multiplicative weights update
  algorithm in this memory-constrained scenario, and design an alternative scheme
  whose regret guarantees are close to the best possible.
