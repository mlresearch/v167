title: On the Initialization for Convex-Concave Min-max Problems
abstract: 'Convex-concave min-max problems are ubiquitous in machine learning, and
  people usually utilize first-order methods (e.g., gradient descent ascent) to find
  the optimal solution. One feature which separates convex-concave min-max problems
  from convex minimization problems is that the best known convergence rates for min-max
  problems have an explicit dependence on the size of the domain, rather than on the
  distance between initial point and the optimal solution. This means that the convergence
  speed does not have any improvement even if the algorithm starts from the optimal
  solution, and hence, is oblivious to the initialization. Here, we show that strict-convexity-strict-concavity
  is sufficient to get the convergence rate to depend on the initialization. We also
  show how different algorithms can asymptotically achieve initialization-dependent
  convergence rates on this class of functions. Furthermore, we show that the so-called
  “parameter-free” algorithms allow to achieve improved initialization-dependent asymptotic
  rates without any learning rate to tune. In addition, we utilize this particular
  parameter-free algorithm as a subroutine to design a new algorithm, which achieves
  a novel non-asymptotic fast rate for strictly-convex-strictly-concave min-max problems
  with a growth condition and H{ö}lder continuous solution mapping. Experiments are
  conducted to verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of
  the proposed algorithms. '
