title: Efficient Methods for Online Multiclass Logistic Regression
abstract: Multiclass logistic regression is a fundamental task in machine learning
  with applications in classification and boosting.   Previous work (Foster et al.,
  2018) has highlighted the importance of improper predictors for achieving “fast
  rates” in the online multiclass logistic regression problem without suffering exponentially
  from secondary problem parameters, such as the norm of the predictors in the comparison
  class. While Foster et al. (2018) introduced a statistically optimal algorithm,
  it is in practice computationally intractable due to its run-time complexity being
  a large polynomial in the time horizon and dimension of input feature vectors. In
  this paper, we develop a new algorithm, FOLKLORE, for the problem which runs significantly
  faster than the algorithm of Foster et al. (2018)–the running time per iteration
  scales quadratically in the dimension–at the cost of a linear dependence on the
  norm of the predictors in the regret bound. This yields the first practical algorithm
  for online multiclass logistic regression, resolving an open problem of Foster et
  al. (2018).  Furthermore, we show that our algorithm can be applied to online bandit
  multiclass prediction and online multiclass boosting, yielding more practical algorithms
  for both problems compared to the ones in Foster et al. (2018) with similar performance
  guarantees. Finally, we also provide an online-to-batch conversion result for our
  algorithm.
